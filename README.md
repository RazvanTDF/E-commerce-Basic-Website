# Basic E-Commerce Website

This is a basic e-commerce project created as part of my learning process. The site includes pages for the homepage, a single product page, shop, about, contact, and a cart. The site is not fully functional, meaning you cannot add products to the cart or perform other advanced functionalities. The project was created by following tutorials and examples on YouTube.

## Site Pages

1. **Homepage**: This is the main page of the site, showcasing featured products and promotions.
2. **Single Product Page**: A page dedicated to a specific product, providing details about that product.
3. **Shop Page**: The shop page displays a list of all available products.
4. **About Page**: This page provides information about the company or website.
5. **Contact Page**: A page with a contact form for users to get in touch.
6. **Cart Page**: This page displays the user's shopping cart. Note that adding products to the cart is not functional.
